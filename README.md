# Labels

The org labels are defined in `labels.json`, please open a PR for any changes.

Any changes will be applied to all repos via the [Sync Org Labels workflow](https://github.com/chainguard-customers/.github/workflows/sync-org-labels.yml).

This only add new labels and update labels it does not remove labels that were created manually in a repository.

When renaming a label, use the `alias` property to specify the old name. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "type: bug",
  "alias": "bug"
}
```
